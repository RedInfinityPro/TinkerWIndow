# About

The code demonstrates the creation of a simple GUI application using Tkinter, a standard Python GUI toolkit. It defines several functions and classes to create different windows and components of the GUI. The MenuBox function creates a title frame and a frame for buttons within the application window. The clear_window function clears all widgets from the window. The MenuWindow function clears the window and creates a menu box with a specific title. The BlackmagicManualWindow function clears the window, creates a menu box with a specific title, and creates a frame for a text box.

# Features

The Tkinter GUI application code consists of several features, including Tkinter utilization, function definitions, class definitions, and window management. Tkinter is Python's standard GUI toolkit used for creating the interface. The application features a menu box, clear_window, menu window, and blackmagic manual window. Class definitions may include classes for complex widgets or data handling. Window management functions manage the opening, closing, and refreshing of different windows within the application. This modular approach allows for the display or hiding of components as needed. For further assistance or specific questions about the implementation, feel free to ask.
